This project is a Spring Boot application that allows users to send SMS messages and save them to a
database. It features two providers for handling HTTP requests: one using a GET method and the
other using a POST method. Additionally, the application includes CRUD functionality for managing
SMS messages, and all interactions can be tested using tools like Postman. The project also utilizes
scheduling and logging for enhanced functionality.
